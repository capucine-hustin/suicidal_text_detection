Auto-categorization has been working on mobile since 2018, but the developers still have not bothered to port this important feature to desktop. Also, I feel that far too many of the options are locked down for premium users, even trivial options like background colors.",0,random_posts,neutral

Not giving 5 stars because of the following reasons : 1. It's very annoying when you enter into a habit page and you swipe down to scroll down to see stats . But it switches to another habit page.

"It's easy enough to use as it is, but for a fully paid app, the graphs are incredibly lackluster and basically useless. All you get is some minuscule, measly bar graphs which are tiny...and get this, they don't even label the metric you're tracking as they are displayed in the order in which your goal list is. So unless you memorize that goal #7 is say exercise daily, you won't even know what you're looking at. Additionally, the streaks are glitchy as hell, and often times do not calculate correctly. Really wish they also had aggregate goals, for example grouping similar goals together and then tracking the success percent for the aggregate. Like say if you have multiple diet goals for no dairy, no gluten, and no sugar, it would be great to group those in the diet category and then see your success there overall and trending graphs. And come on, add some pie charts and the ability to look at graphs in intervals aside from a single month.",0,random_posts,neutral

"Love the program and it's definitely an improvement over Google Calendar. Just the easy moving back and forth between dates using the 'go to' feature is a huge plus in my book. It does have some short comings that are irritating to me at least. I use my calendar to keep track of my to do lists. I save them in the Description field. First off the editing features such as bolding, underlining, line numbering, etc don't appear anywhere unless like in my case you accidently discover them by doing a couple of steps of bizarre gymnastics. Once found I loved the features. However the first thing that is annoying is that if you have a long list of things that go past one screen you have to keep scrolling down to access those features. Would be nice if there was a button or tab that would open a stationary bar at the top or a floating window that moves with the screen. Second issue is definitely a software bug having to do with the line numbering. Once a line numbering list has been established and you want to go back to add a new line or change the priority by moving things up and down the system does odd things.",0,random_posts,neutral

I've been using BC1 for years and I've installed BC2 on at least 2 seperate occasions. BC2 is so not as good as BC1. The overall look makes it look like a cheap childs game. The functionality became nonsensical and it made going back to BC1 such a pleasure. I can't imagine what the developers were thinking when making such changes. After using BC1 for so long I had high hopes for its future development but alas it not to be. These days I'm looking elsewhere.,0,random_posts,neutral

"Is it true that non-premium version soon will loose any way for backup/restore or transfer to another phone? If not true: Please point to me what is the backup/restore way that stays in app in the future. Thanks a lot!. If true: That is really bad news - backup is a basic necessity, so non-premium version will become practically useless on the long term. In addition, premium costs twice as much for a single year than, let's say OsmAnd+ for eternity. And that is a much more complex app + the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits. Tasks is a really nice app (except that swichingt between sublists/lists is unreasonably slow) with some unique and essential features. But this wracks it, it will drive me away. Possibly others too. Not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that. RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S RESPONSE: That is fair enough, except for one important detail: all the people using your free app are now forced to decide - if they want to have a meaningful app - to pay or search for another app. Premium app should only add features and not restrict free app's capabilities. If you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing, people will buy it. Lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them, now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay. I payed for a number of apps (all cheaper than yours btw.), and actually my plan was to pay/donate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear, because I thought the app is really useful and it deserves support. This change is different. I do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc., just that you should not remove the free local backup (or any other feature). Or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start. Best wishes! RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S SECOND RESPONSE: Actually you can clearly see from my review that I do not want everything for free. My problem is different. If we could not understand each other so far, perhaps it's not worth trying any more. So I won't comment on the rest of your answer. All the best!",0,random_posts,neutral

Now, however, it requires more steps to add to-dos, and is becoming more of a complicated app, loosing the original appeal. As of some time ago, notifications also stopped working, which mean I will leave, after some 5+ years of use.",0,random_posts,neutral

New update was step backwards. My recommemdations: 1) Have daily/weekly/monthly calendar views that show reminders and events in visual boxes (instead of just a list). 2) allow rearranging of the order of subtasks and add subtask reminder capability. Also should be able to check off individual subtasks. 3) allow a task to be turned into a calendar event instead of just a reminder 4) show that an event has subtasks from main view,0,random_posts,neutral

I did not mean ""tasks"", poor choice of words on my part. I meant that if I have an event at 9pm today, and the time now is 6am, I will not see this at all.

Edit: I don't know how to answer so I'll edit and hopefully it gets trough. If I can get something back, I would like the choice to go horizontal (make it a choice on pro). A bunch of horizontal scrolls is not a problem if instead I have to do a bunch of vertical ones. Looks less intuitive to me. And I can use the go-to option, but I kinda already could and never did. I liked to scroll horizontal, because I liked the view that it gave me, and the side comparison of days on same level.",0,random_posts,positive

For now what I'm really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself, with the left and right arrows, and not only from inside the app. Why wouldn't you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default? Having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget, and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself. Other than that, the app seems to be very practical. If the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented, it would be a 5 star app for me.

"● 2019-10-15 EDIT: Just wanted to update my previous reviews to say that the problem I initially encountered seems to have gone away. I don't know exactly when, or how (maybe thanks to an automatic update of the app itself or Android), but TimeTune notifications now happen reliably and on time, just as you would expect, so I'm now upgrading my initial 4 stars to 5 stars—big thanks to the devs! ● 2018-11-05 EDIT: Already in touch with support and testing. After restarting my device it appears to be working, but I will need to test for a few days before I can confirm ● INITIAL REVIEW: App itself is great, but Android keeps closing it after a few minutes of inactivity. As a result, notifications don't happen. I've followed the troubleshooting steps which I was already familiar with and have worked for other apps. just not for TimeTune. I wish I could fix this, it's such a great app!",0,random_posts,positive

A great recommended app. Finding it useful so far. Be great if available on computer too to sync. I had been using another good app for years but recently gotten taken over by big company and absorb resulting in event forced to use their alternative. Searched for replacement and discovered this app by accident and it is FANTASTIC! Easy to use and great features makes organising life a breeze. Very happy so far.,0,random_posts,positive

"Real nice app. I like links to google calendar for events, reminders. Not sure about tasks. Have you guys thought about drag and drop between tasks and events? It'd be perfect for time blocking or scheduling tasks. Right now I use a zapier that takes new tasks in a specific list and lists them as 5 am on today's calendar. I'd like to drag them to certain times so my schedule doesn't fill up (shows time blocks as busy in Calendar). Thanks",0,random_posts,positive

"Great habit tracking tool. The widget on the home screen is a great size so I can see quickly how well I'm doing, and the options at set up are thorough. I'm tracking all sorts of things and it's easy to see how I'm doing. Highly recommended. Only concern is I'm having trouble getting a response on a _potential_ issue I have (not sure it's real yet, but if it is I'm concerned). Otherwise five stars.",0,random_posts,positive

Wow! I tried many apps like this. And in my experience this app is the best one! So easy to use! After other apps with too many options and not understandable design this app is perfect! You just click '+' and enter the name! That's all! Of course if you want you can add time and date and something else. I recommend!,0,random_posts,positive

I'm using it to stop biting my nails, which I've tried to stop doing for probably 15 years! Also keeping track of when in sticking to my sleep and diet schedule, and a bunch of other habits I'm trying to establish. It's important to have a way to hold yourself accountable!

I like it so far and I bought the 24 hours extension. The only complain that I have is the buttons that sit on the four corners of the widget is very hard to precisely click. I got very frustrated every time I try to click it. Most of the time it'lll trigger to move the widget itself. ☹️,0,random_posts,positive
